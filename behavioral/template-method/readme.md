## Template Method

The Template Method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, delegating some steps to subclasses.

It allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure.

It is useful when you have an algorithm that follows a sequence of steps and you want to allow subclasses to redefine some of those steps.
