# Design Patterns Repository

This repository contains examples and explanations of various design patterns. Design patterns are categorized into three types:

1. **Creational Patterns**
2. **Structural Patterns**
3. **Behavioral Patterns**

Each type has its own folder with detailed explanations and examples of the design patterns it contains.

## Creational Patterns

Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code. Examples include:

- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. Examples include:

- Adapter
- Composite
- Proxy
- Flyweight
- Facade
- Bridge
- Decorator

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Examples include:

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

Each pattern has its own folder with a detailed README file explaining the pattern, its use cases, and examples.
