##Â Decorator pattern
It is a structural design pattern that allows adding functionalities to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain these functionalities.

Do not confuse it with TypeScript decorators which are annotations.

It is useful when you need to add functionalities to objects in a dynamic and flexible way.
