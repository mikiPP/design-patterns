/**
 * ! Builder Pattern:
 * It is a creational design pattern that allows us to construct complex objects
 * step by step.
 *
 * The pattern allows us to produce different types and representations
 * of an object using the same construction code.
 *
 * * It is useful when we need to construct a complex object with many parts
 * * and we want the construction process to be independent of the parts
 * * that compose it.
