## Builder Pattern:

It is a creational design pattern that allows us to construct complex objects step by step.

The pattern allows us to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

It is useful when we need to construct a complex object with many parts and we want the construction process to be independent of the parts that compose it.
