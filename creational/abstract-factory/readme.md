## Abstract Factory:

It is a design pattern that allows creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Instead of creating individual objects directly, we create factories that produce a set of related objects.

It is useful when you need to create objects that are part of a family and want to ensure that these objects complement each other.
